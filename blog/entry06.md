# Entry 6
##### 6/1/24

### After presenting to both the class and the judges for this year I feel like I did grow in some areas than I did last year but missed out on a few things for my presentation. First for my grows, I think for this year for presenting in front of the class I think I did well on expressing my challenges for my final project. I feel like this time I could go into mmore detail about my challeneges this year than I did last year because I had code to show how the challenge has been preventing my progress and how I over came it. And for my other challenge it was more new for me since it was one that I wasnt able to overcame but still attempted. Something I couldve growed on was having my slides more prepared as I needed help getting a link to my project the same day of the presentation. I also shouldve made more of a plot or story to my game to make it more appealing since the evem though the game itself is good there could always be more to be improved on. I also couldve added more visuals for my slides to make them stand out. As for presenting to the judges it went really well this year when it came to presenting since it was more straightforward to have a project that was more for entertainment than for a product like last year. I was more calmer during the presentation compared to other times and had no problem answering the questions but again, I feel like what was missing from my project was a final destination or plot to go with it so its not just a random game.
