#### I have chosen to work on learning kaboom to make my freedom project to make a game that is a space themed platformer that plays in a mario and megaman style. When choosing a tool the two I was deciding on were phaser and kaboom. I ended up choosing kaboom because the website has more resources on it than phaser and I think it'd be a better tool to use for my project. The main spot where i've been doing most of my learning is in the tutorial page where it teaches you how to make a simple game.The [tutorial page](https://kaboomjs.com/doc/intro) uses some of the basic elements that kaboom offers. There's a default sprite that is always used in these changes and some of the things I learned were to change the gravity, insert my own sprite and create an object that can cause the player to collide and restart to the beginning. For my engineering design process is to brainstorm possible solutions to the problem because right now I can learn which things I need to learn to create my game and which ones I also might want to include that I didn't think I needed. For the next stage I want to have all the right components in my game so that it turns out like how I imagined it. Reading the documentation for kaboom has been the biggest reason for my learning because oftentimes when I'm wondering why my code didn't work and the console doesn't give me any error I often realized I didn't read the documentation carefully enough.
